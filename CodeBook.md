## About the data
- Refer to 'UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt' to see how raw data was created
- Each column is a variable
- Each row is activity Measurements by Subject
- Training set X_train.txt & Test set X_test.txt combined to form one data set
- y_train & y_test: training & test label respectively combine to form activity label column
- subject_train & subject_test: Training & Test subject label combine to form subject label column
- Activity Label column values are replaced with activity names from 'UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt'
- Other Column Names are taken from 'UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt'
- Feature description can be found in 'UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt'
