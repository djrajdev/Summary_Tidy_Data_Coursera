# The CodeBook
Describes Variables, Data & Transformations

## About the data
- Refer to 'UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt' to see how raw data was created
- Each column is a variable
- Each row is activity Measurements by Subject
- Training set X_train.txt & Test set X_test.txt combined to form one data set
- y_train & y_test: training & test label respectively combine to form activity label column
- subject_train & subject_test: Training & Test subject label combine to form subject label column
- Activity Label column values are replaced with activity names from 'UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt'
- Other Column Names are 'mean' and 'std' columns taken from list 'UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt' 
- Column names slightly changed from 'UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt' (no parenthesis in colnames)
- Feature description can be found in 'UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt'
- Finally, 'mean aggregate' is performed on tidy data from above

## Miscellaneous Code
Also provided is some additional commented out code for convenience (eg. Set Working Directory, test temp file)
